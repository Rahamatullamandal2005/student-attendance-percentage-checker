📊 Attendance & Bunk Planner

A simple and practical web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help college students calculate their attendance percentage and plan safe bunking without falling below the required attendance criteria.

🚀 About the Project

Maintaining minimum attendance is a common challenge for college students. Many students often find themselves calculating attendance manually and wondering, “Aaj bunk kar sakte hai kya?” 

The Attendance & Bunk Planner solves this problem by providing a clean and easy-to-use interface where students can input their attendance details and instantly get accurate results. The application calculates the current attendance percentage, determines the attendance status, and shows how many classes can be safely skipped.

This project focuses on clarity, usability, and logical correctness, rather than unnecessary complexity.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML – Structure

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Logic, calculations, and data handling

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of core frontend development concepts, especially using JavaScript for real-world problem solving. I gained hands-on experience in writing logical conditions, performing percentage-based calculations, and handling user input validation to prevent incorrect or unrealistic data entries.

This project also helped me understand how client-side data persistence works using localStorage, allowing the application to retain user input even after a page refresh. Additionally, focusing on a clean and minimal UI improved my ability to design user-friendly interfaces while maintaining readable and structured code. Overall, the project reinforced the importance of building practical applications that combine logic, usability, and simplicity.

🔮 Future Improvements

While the current version of the Attendance & Bunk Planner effectively solves a basic student problem, there is significant scope for enhancement. In future iterations, the application can be extended to support multiple subjects, allowing students to track attendance individually for each course. Adding a visual progress bar or chart would further improve user experience by representing attendance data more intuitively.

Other possible improvements include making the application fully responsive for mobile devices, adding a reset or edit history feature, and providing reminders or alerts when attendance approaches the danger zone. These enhancements would not only increase functionality but also help in scaling the project into a more comprehensive student management tool.
